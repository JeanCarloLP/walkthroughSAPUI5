# Component-preload (Error in console)
Essentially the component preload concatenates all the files used by the component, 
that is all the controllers, views, formatters etc into a single file and minifies the js, 
json and xml code. 
The idea being that 1 minified file for all you components is loaded a lot quicker 
than many un-minified files. Its very effective at reducing the loading of applications.
